# Label Chest

**Label Chest** is a lightweight quality-of-life (QoL) mod for Stardew Valley that helps you keep your farm organized. It allows you to assign custom text labels to any chest, which are then displayed as floating text in the game world.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Integrated UI**: Adds a "Set Label" button directly inside the chest inventory menu for quick access.
*   **In-World Labels**: Your custom labels float neatly above your chests, using a clean, vanilla-friendly font style.
*   **Smart Text Wrapping**: Long names are automatically wrapped into multiple lines to ensure they remain readable on your screen.
*   **Safe Data Storage**: Labels are saved using the game's native `modData` system. This means your labels are tied to your save file and won't be lost if you update the mod.
*   **Multiplayer Compatible**: Works perfectly in co-op sessions!
